The idea for this project is to create my own both more advanced and
compute efficient version of the project below.

I saw this project originally in a youtube video by youtuber TheChiptide
[https://www.youtube.com/@TheChiptide](url) and he encouraged people to try and make a more efficient version of it, I
decided to take it one step further and to also include a 3rd colour via 
spinda's shiny form.
